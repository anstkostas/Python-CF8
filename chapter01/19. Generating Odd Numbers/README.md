# 🔢 Python Range Demonstration

This lesson explores the use of Python's `range()` function, with a focus on generating sequences of numbers—especially odd numbers. You'll learn how to construct ranges with different start, stop, and step values, and apply them in practical programming tasks.

---

## 1. Learning Objectives

- Understand the syntax and behavior of Python's `range()` function.
- Generate sequences of numbers with custom start, stop, and step values.
- Use `range()` to efficiently produce odd numbers within a given interval.
- Iterate over ranges using `for` loops for practical tasks.
- Recognize common pitfalls when working with `range()`.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- Basic Python syntax (variables, print, indentation).
- Familiarity with `for` loops.
- Understanding of integer arithmetic.

---

## 3. Key Concepts

- **range(start, stop, step)**: Built-in function that generates an immutable sequence of numbers from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive), incremented by `step`.
- **Start**: The first value in the sequence (default is 0).
- **Stop**: The sequence ends before this value.
- **Step**: The difference between each number in the sequence (default is 1).
- **Odd Numbers**: Integers not divisible by 2; can be generated by starting at an odd number and stepping by 2.

## 4. Lecture Outline

### 0:00–0:05 — Introduction to `range()`
- What is `range()`? Why is it useful?
- Syntax overview: `range(stop)`, `range(start, stop)`, `range(start, stop, step)`

### 0:05–0:12 — Exploring Range Parameters
- Demonstrate default behavior: `range(5)` → 0,1,2,3,4
- Using start and stop: `range(2, 7)` → 2,3,4,5,6
- Using step: `range(1, 10, 2)` → 1,3,5,7,9

### 0:12–0:18 — Generating Odd Numbers
- How to generate odd numbers between 1 and 20
- Why starting at 1 and stepping by 2 works
- Example: `range(1, 21, 2)`

### 0:18–0:23 — Practical Applications and Pitfalls
- Iterating over a range in a `for` loop
- Off-by-one errors: remembering stop is exclusive
- Negative steps: counting down

### 0:23–0:30 — Q&A and Summary
- Recap key points
- Common mistakes and debugging tips

## 5. Code Demos

```
# Python 2 vs Python 3 range functionality discussion
# Python 2: `range()` returned a list, not memory efficient
# Python 3: `range()` returns a range object, which is much more memory efficient

# Print odd numbers from 1 to 21 using a traditional Java-style approach in Python
print("Java style")
for i in range(22):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i, end=' ')
print()

# Print odd numbers from 1 to 21 using Python's efficient range with step parameter
print("Python style")
for i in range(1, 22, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()
```

## 5.1 Extra Code Demos
```python
# Basic usage of range()
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # Output: 0 1 2 3 4

# Using start and stop
for i in range(2, 7):
    print(i)  # Output: 2 3 4 5 6

# Using step to generate odd numbers
for i in range(1, 21, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')  # Output: 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19

print()  # For newline

# Generating odd numbers between any two values
start = 11
stop = 30
for i in range(start, stop, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')  # Output: 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29

print()

# Negative step: counting down
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i, end=' ')  # Output: 10 8 6 4 2
```

## 6. Exercises

### 1. (Level 1, MCQ)
Which of the following will generate the sequence `3, 5, 7, 9`?

a) `range(3, 10, 2)`  
b) `range(3, 9, 2)`  
c) `range(3, 10, 3)`  
d) `range(3, 11, 2)`

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Answer:** a) `range(3, 10, 2)` and d) `range(3, 11, 2)`  
Both generate 3, 5, 7, 9.  
- `range(3, 10, 2)` gives 3, 5, 7, 9  
- `range(3, 11, 2)` gives 3, 5, 7, 9 (and would include 11 if stop were inclusive, but stop is exclusive)
</details>

### 2. (Level 1, Short Answer)
What is the output of the following code?

```python
for i in range(2, 8, 3):
    print(i, end=' ')
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Output:** `2 5 `
- Starts at 2, adds 3 → 5, adds 3 → 8 (stop, so loop ends)
</details>

---

### 3. (Level 2, Coding)
Write a Python loop to print all odd numbers from 15 to 25 (inclusive) on one line, separated by spaces.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
for i in range(15, 26, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')
# Output: 15 17 19 21 23 25 
```
</details>

---

### 4. (Level 2, Coding)
Given two variables, `start = 8` and `stop = 20`, write code to print all odd numbers between `start` and `stop` (inclusive), regardless of whether `start` is odd or even.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
start = 8
stop = 20
# If start is even, make it odd
if start % 2 == 0:
    start += 1
for i in range(start, stop + 1, 2):
    print(i, end=' ')
# Output: 9 11 13 15 17 19 
```
</details>

---

### 5. (Level 3, Coding)
Write a function `odd_numbers_between(a, b)` that returns a list of all odd numbers between `a` and `b` (inclusive), where `a` and `b` can be in any order (i.e., a may be less than or greater than b).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```python
def odd_numbers_between(a, b):
    # Ensure a <= b
    start, stop = min(a, b), max(a, b)
    # Make start odd if it's even
    if start % 2 == 0:
        start += 1
    # range is exclusive, so stop+1
    return list(range(start, stop + 1, 2))

# Example usage:
print(odd_numbers_between(12, 21))  # Output: [13, 15, 17, 19, 21]
print(odd_numbers_between(21, 12))  # Output: [13, 15, 17, 19, 21]
```
</details>
